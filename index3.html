	<p class="middle">To become sucessful i need to go to college. The college i want to go to is New York University which is also known as NYU. NYU is one of the best schools thats in New York and the medical school is also one of the best in the country. With a school like this it makes it ideal for me to choose as a school. The school is located in Manhattan and its about 1 hour away from me on the train. Going to NYU will make me sucessful because lots of people who already went there became sucessful and i could become like them. The school is also not that far compared to similar schools near me. For almost all the schools i need to travel about 1 hour anyway so why not choose the better school to go to.

	<p2> To give back to people ill donate to charities in brooklyn and all over the city which helps people. I would also give free treatment to people who cant afford to pay for their treatment. If someone also cant afford their treatment but its for another doctor ill still pay for it because i could probally afford to do it. In addition i would feed people who need it, like homeless people. I'll do a food drive or just go around giving it to people who need it. Also maybe give a scholarship to people who cant afford to go to college but is actually really smart.
