		<h1>Future Me</h1>
		<p class="middle">When i get older i want to work in the medical field. I either want to become an anestiologist or maybe a different type of doctor. im not sure yet. I plan to be sucessful by attending school everyday, not cutting class and just doing my best whenever i do something. I would also stay in school and not drop out becuase getting a college education greatly increases your employment chances so i would rather get a degree than stay home with no job. For college i want to go to NYU or Columbia University. thses are the best 2 schools for medical professions and they are located here in New York so its a good idea to try and go to that as a school.

		<br>	
		<p2>Going to college will help me become succesful. If i want to work in the medical field i have to have a degree or no one will hire me. i will end up staying home on the couch for the rest of my life without a degree. Also i want to make my money through hard work and not  through a short cut and going to college would be good to get me to that goal. In addition, i want to make my money by helping people and not doing people wrong.
